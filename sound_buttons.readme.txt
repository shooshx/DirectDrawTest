Display 3 buttons which
- play a sound using PlaySound
- play a sound using mciSendString
- open a different sound file
using PlaySound is simple but it can only play one sound at a time
using mciSendString it is possible to mix several sounds at the same time
mciSendSound takes a command string. some useful commands:
  "play file.wav"
  "open file.wav alias 123"
  "play 123"
  "close 123"
in order to play the same sound file again and again at the same you need to open it with different aliases each time.
otherwise it would only play once.
After the sound is done playing, the main window receives MM_MCINOTIFY and the handler for this message calls mciSendCommand(MCI_CLOSE) to close the file
